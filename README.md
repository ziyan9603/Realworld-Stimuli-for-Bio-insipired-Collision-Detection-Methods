# Realworld-Stimuli-for-Bio-insipired-Collision-Detection-Methods
This open dataset represents looming, translating, receding of a ball recorded in an indoor scene, which can be effectively used for testing motion perception visual systems.
This is a data set that describes the common moving modes of a ball, which are approaching, receding and translating. 
Here are the details about the dataset:

Total number of videos: 146
Resolution: 720*480
Frames per second (fps): 59.94
Naming convention:

Ball color: Black or White
Speed: High or Low
Moving mood: App (Approaching), Rece (Receding), Trans (Translation)
ID: Unique identifier for each video
Special cases:

'black/white + black/white' type describes two balls moving, with the color of the first appearing one written first in the name.
There are two versions of translation: one begins and ends with the ball out of vision (named "trans"), and the other begins and ends with the ball in vision (named with "IV" at the beginning).
Quantities for each class:

Black High App: 6 videos
Black Low App: 6 videos
Black High Rece: 9 videos
Black Low Rece: 14 videos
Black High Trans: 6 videos
Black Low Trans: 12 videos
IV Black High Trans: 6 videos
IV Black Low Trans: 6 videos
Black Black Trans: 3 videos
Black White Trans: 4 videos
White High App: 6 videos
White Low App: 6 videos
White High Rece: 11 videos
White Low Rece: 11 videos
White High Trans: 6 videos
White Low Trans: 15 videos
IV White High Trans: 6 videos
IV White Low Trans: 6 videos
White Black Trans: 4 videos
White White Trans: 3 videos
Notes:

The ball moves in front of a static, clean background.
Most videos suffer from reflections of the moving ball.
Some stimuli have a slightly shifted vision or long static state before moving.
