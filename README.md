# Realworld-Stimuli-for-Bio-insipired-Collision-Detection-Methods
This open dataset represents looming, translating, receding of a ball recorded in an indoor scene, which can be effectively used for testing motion perception visual systems.
Below are the details about the videos/stimuli:

Total number of videos: 69
Resolution: 720*480
Frames per second (fps): 59.94
Naming convention:

Ball color: Black or White
Moving type: App (Approaching), Rece (Receding), Trans (Translation)
Abbreviations in names and their full names, along with their quantities:
App: Approaching (11 Black, 3 White)
Rece: Receding (10 Black, 13 White)
Trans: Translation (13 Black, 8 White)
App nc: Approaching but not colliding (2 Black, 2 White)
App2rece: Approaching then receding (3 Black, 2 White)
Rece2app: Receding then approaching (2 White)
Notes:

The velocity of the moving ball is not controlled.
Most of the white and black receding stimuli also contain a short period of ball approaching (a rebound after the ball hits the wall).
Some ball receding stimuli experience strong light changes at the beginning of the video.
Some stimuli have a moving background at the beginning of the video.
